Homework 6

Answer to Problem 7:

Our null hypothesis is that the 2009 Iranian election was not fraudulent.
However after writing these programs to test just how confident we can be in 
said hypothesis, I can say we reject our null hypothesis at the p = 0.0385 level.
The threshold for statistical significance is p = 0.05, and we are under that
threshold. I ran the program several times and never got a p value below 0.0385,
and I even saw one as low 0.035.

Answer to Problem 8:

Like the previous data set, we will assume going in that the 2008 US election
was not fraudulent. Then we run the same tests as we did on the Iranian data set.
This time we can say that we do not reject the null hypothesis, due to the fact
that usually the p value is near 0.5, well above the threshold of p = 0.05. Therefore
We say we reject the null hypothesis.
